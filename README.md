## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- This app uses the `googletrans` library, which relies on unofficial Google Translate APIs. For production environments, consider using official APIs like Google Cloud Translation or Microsoft Azure Translator.
- The `source` language is optional; if omitted, the translator will attempt to auto-detect it.
